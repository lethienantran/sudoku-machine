<h3> ABOUT IT </h3> 
<p>
After reading a book called "JavaScript and jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development" by Jon Duckett, I have learned a lot about DOM Manipulation and jQuery. Luckily, I was spending my time playing sudoku after a long day, and I decide to make a Sudoku Game - Solver app as a way to practice and use the knowledge I learned from the book. I also spend my time practice on making a little animation on button to get better. The documents that helped me to work on the generator algorithm will be listed in the following list of URLS:</p>
